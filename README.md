# DonorsChoose
DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website.

Next year, DonorsChoose.org expects to receive close to 500,000 project proposals. As a result, there are three main problems they need to solve:

How to scale current manual processes and resources to screen 500,000 projects so that they can be posted as quickly and as efficiently as possible
How to increase the consistency of project vetting across different volunteers to improve the experience for teachers
How to focus volunteer time on the applications that need the most assistance
The goal of the competition is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.

Additionally, the `resources.csv` data set provides more data about the resources required for each project. Each line in this file represents a resource required by a project:

**`id`** | A `project_id` value from the `train.csv` file.  **Example:** `p036502`

**`quantity`** | Quantity of the resource required. **Example:** `3`   
**`price`** | Price of the resource required. **Example:** `9.95`   

**Note:** Many projects require multiple resources. The `id` value corresponds to a `project_id` in train.csv, so you use it as a key to retrieve all resources needed for a project:

The data set contains the following label (the value you will attempt to predict):

Label | Description
----------|---------------
`project_is_approved` | A binary flag indicating whether DonorsChoose approved the project. A value of `0` indicates the project was not approved, and a value of `1` indicates the project was approved.
